# Sales Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict sales based on historical data and relevant features such as marketing spend, seasonal trends, and product performance. The entire workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans the dataset, handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes trends, correlations, and patterns influencing sales performance.
- **Model Building:** Trains multiple regression models (such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest) to forecast sales.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² to evaluate model accuracy.
- **Feature Importance:** Identifies key drivers that most influence sales.

## Applications
- Retail sales forecasting
- Inventory planning
- Marketing budget optimization
- Seasonal demand prediction

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook sales_prediction.ipynb
```
3. Run all cells to train models and see predictions.
