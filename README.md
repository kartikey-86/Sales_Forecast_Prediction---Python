 # Sales Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict sales based on historical data and relevant features such as marketing spend, seasonal trends, and product performance. The entire workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans the dataset, handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes trends, correlations, and patterns influencing sales performance.
- **Model Building:** Trains multiple regression models (such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest) to forecast sales.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² to evaluate model accuracy.
- **Feature Importance:** Identifies key drivers that most influence sales.

## Applicationsforecasting

- Seasonal demand prediction

## Requirements
